                        <strong>Flying into Devonport:</strong> The closest airport is Devonport airport. We strongly recommend flying in at least one day prior as regional flights are cancelled last minute on occasion. If you do not hire a car, you will need to get a taxi from the airport (around 20 min ride) as there is no rideshare service on the North West coast.<br>
                        <strong>Flying into Launceston:</strong> Launceston Airport is a 100km, one-hour drive (approx) from Hawley Beach. Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin fly into this airport. A hire car will be required if you fly into Launceston.<br>
                        <strong>Sailing into Devonport:</strong> The Spirit of Tasmania ferry runs day/night sails every day. Travel time is around 12 hours, and vehicles can be brought onboard. The Spirit docks in Devonport, around 25 mins from Hawley Beach.
